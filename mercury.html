            <h1>Mercury</h1>
            <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. 
                Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed 
                ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history.
                Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind.
                Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. 
                Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact; or, 
                that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.</p>
