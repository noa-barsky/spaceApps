            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <p>Mars (1.5 AU from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus. It has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a 
                surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth). Its surface, peppered with vast 
                volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that
                 may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its red colour comes from iron oxide (rust) 
                 in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be either captured asteroids,
                  or ejected debris from a massive impact early in Mars's history.</p>
